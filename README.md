Thanks for checking out the plugin! Currently, this is still under development, but it should work. The build instructions are probably not quite right. You'd need to cd to the sub directory first, but I'll fix it later.

No helpfile yet. Currently resonance is 0-1 where 1 is more resonant. 

It's a bit heavy, but it sounds sweet. Working on optimization. There is 2x oversampling and logistic nonlinear distortion applied after the filter.
