Thanks for checking out the plugin! Currently, this is still under development, but it should work. The build instructions are probably not quite right. You'd need to cd to the parent first, but I'll fix it later.

No helpfile yet. Currently resonance is 0-1 with 0 being more resonant to mimic other resonant filters in SC, but that's kind of annoying/misleading because it's not actually reciprocal of Q...

Filter starts to alias over about 10% of the Nyquist rate :( currently working on fixing this
